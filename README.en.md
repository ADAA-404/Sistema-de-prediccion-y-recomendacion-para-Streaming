# Netflix-style Churn Prediction & Recommendation System üçø

This project presents a comprehensive data science process for a fictional streaming service, focusing on two fundamental business goals: predicting user churn and enhancing user engagement through a personalized movie recommendation system. It demonstrates the ability to manage the entire data science lifecycle, from data cleaning and feature engineering to model implementation and explainability.   

## Data Source üíæ

The project uses a synthetic dataset obtained publicly from Kaggle. The data is divided into several CSV files, which can be downloaded and viewed here:

## Technologies Used üêç
This project was developed using a solid set of Python libraries and tools to cover the entire script lifecycle.  

-   Pandas y NumPy: For data cleaning, manipulation, and feature engineering.  
-   Scikit-learn: For data splitting, model evaluation, and the implementation of the KNN-based recommendation system.  
-   XGBoost: A high-performance gradient boosting library used to build the churn prediction model.  
-   SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): A powerful library for explaining machine learning model outputs, fundamental for communicating business insights.  
-   Matplotlib y Seaborn: For data visualization, including statistical charts and SHAP results.  
-   Streamlit: For creating and deploying the interactive web dashboard, which presents the project's results in a user-friendly format.  
-   Joblib: To efficiently save and load trained machine learning models, which speeds up the application.

## Installation Considerations ‚öôÔ∏è

To set up and run this project, it's recommended to use a conda environment. These libraries will help you create the necessary environment:  

bash
    ```
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn XGBoost seaborn matplotlib SHAP Streamlit Joblib
    ```  
    
Data Setup: Ensure that the data files from the Kaggle dataset are located in the working directory within the project's structure.  
Run the Script: Simply run the main script to ensure functionality from scratch, or deploy Streamlit assuming you have the files attached in the repository to work with the base version.  

## Usage Example üìé

The solution pipeline is a multi-phase process created with Python (tested in a Jupyter Notebook) and implemented with Streamlit.  

Data Engineering & Feature Creation:  
-   Data Consolidation: The three CSV files were merged into a single, unified DataFrame.    
-   Churn Definition: Churn was defined as a period of inactivity of 30, 60, or 90 days.    
-  Engagement Metrics: To quantify user engagement, including total_watch_duration, sessions_per_week, and unique_genres_watched.

Churn Prediction Model:  
-   Model Selection: An XGBoost classifier was chosen for its high performance and ability to handle structured data.  
-   Model Performance: The model achieved an accuracy of 0.82 and a high recall of 0.92 (can be further verified with more procedures).

Model Explainability with SHAP:  
-   Key Insight: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used, where the analysis revealed that sessions_per_week and unique_genres_watched were the two most important factors for predicting customer churn.

Movie Recommendation System:  
-   Methodology: A collaborative filtering approach was implemented using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).     
-   User-Item Matrix: User engagement was quantified using a progress percentage metric, which was used to build a sparse user-item matrix for the KNN model.    
-   Result: The system successfully recommends movies to users based on the viewing habits of similar users, providing a more personalized experience.

Dashboard Deployment:  
-   The entire project is implemented as an interactive web application using Streamlit.
